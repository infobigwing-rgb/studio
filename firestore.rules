/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for Remian Edit Studio.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes strict authorization based on user ownership and role-based access,
 * while maintaining flexibility in data shapes for rapid prototyping.  It avoids complex
 * `get()` calls by denormalizing access control data directly onto documents.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: User profiles, accessible only to the user themselves.
 * - /templates/{templateId}: Public templates, write-protected for non-admin users.
 * - /projects/{projectId}: Collaborative projects with access controlled by a 'collaborators' map.
 * - /renders/{renderId}: Render jobs, accessible to project owners or collaborators.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User data is strictly private; no user listing is allowed.
 * - Templates are publicly readable but not writable except by authorized users (not modeled explicitly).
 * - All write operations require explicit authorization checks.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `projects` collection uses a `collaborators` map to store user roles directly within the
 *   project document. This eliminates the need for complex lookups in security rules and makes
 *   access control more efficient.
